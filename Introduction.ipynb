    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview:\n",
    "Diabetes is a severe health challenge for our species, with significant implications for affected individuals. Early diagnosis and interventions are needed to mitigate the long term complications associated with diabetes. One demographic group with a particularly high prevalence of diabetes is the Pima Indian population.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data description\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a dataset used sourced by \"whenamancodes\" from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It is curated to aid in the diagnosis of diabetes among this demographic group. This dataset focuses on female patients of Pima Indian heritage who are at least 21 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Source: Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/predict-diabities/\n",
    "\n",
    "This data includes a range of diagnostic measurements taken from individuals, which serve as a basis for predicting the presence of diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collection\n",
    "The data has been selected from a larger database under specific constraints to provide insights into diabetes occurrence in the selected demographic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable description\n",
    "`Pregnancies` - Number of times pregnant \\\n",
    "`Glucose` - Glucose concentration \\\n",
    "`BloodPressure` - Diastolic blood pressure \\\n",
    "`SkinThickness` - Skin fold thickness \\\n",
    "`Insulin` - insulin levels in the body\\\n",
    "`BMI` - Body mass index \\\n",
    "`DiabetesPedigreeFunction` - Diabetes pedigree function \\\n",
    "`Age` - years alive \\\n",
    "`Outcome` - Class variable (0 or 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "- All the variables are of numeric data type\n",
    "## Target Variable\n",
    "Outcome: \n",
    "- Indicates whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).\n",
    "- The dependent variable used for model prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Considerstions\n",
    "We are including all the variables for the initial exploratory data analysis, certain variables may have more significance in modeling based on their correlations and impact on the outcome. The process involves evaluating each variable's contribution to the predictive model and making informed decisions about which variables to include for optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question we want to explore\n",
    "???\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables Involved\n",
    "- Response Variable: `Outcome`\n",
    "- Explanatory Variables:\\\n",

    "\n",
    "The motive of our study ???rephrase research question???. Additionally, the study aims to assess whether incorporating interaction effects among these variables enhances predictive models for diabetes diagnosis. By addressing these, this research contributes to understanding the modifiable and non-modifiable (variables of the dataset) risk factors of diabetes. Existing literature provides us with a foundation for this analysis. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **BMI and Diabetes Risk Across Ethnic Groups**\n",
    "\n",
    "    A study published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology examined the association between BMI and the risk of type 2 diabetes across various ethnic groups in England. The research found that the BMI threshold for increased diabetes risk varies significantly among different ethnic populations. For instance, South Asian individuals exhibited a higher diabetes risk at lower BMI levels compared to White populations. This highlights the importance of considering ethnic-specific BMI cutoffs when assessing diabetes risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Interaction Effects in Logistic Regression Models for Health Outcomes**\n",
    "\n",
    "    An article in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology discussed the importance of including interaction terms in logistic regression models to accurately capture the combined effects of multiple variables on health outcomes. The study emphasized that failing to account for interactions can lead to misleading conclusions, as the effect of one predictor may depend on the level of another. This highlights the importance of exploring interaction effects to fully understand the relationships between risk factors and health conditions."
